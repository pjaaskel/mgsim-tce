integration API usability
-------------------------
- The width of the memory operations should be returned from the OSAL.
  Now they are hard coded because base.opp has wrong values for smaller
  scalar accesses.
- When one replaces a memory model with an MGSim one, it could
  automatically search for any LSUs that access it and replace them
  with MGSim models aswell.

integration to TCE
------------------
- TCE should detect if MGSim is available: the MGSim dynlib from
  Raphael?
- add system simulation test cases to the TCE systemtest suite
- add documentation on usage

misc/optimizations
------------------
- ttasim's data memory initialization might go through the whole data 
  memory for nothing, i.e., call the admin methods in the startup for all
  addresses. Check if this is the case and if it could be optimized.

simulation test cases to add
----------------------------
- dual port ideal SRAM case (two scalar LSUs)
- DRAM with variable latency (one scalar LSU)
- multibanked vector loads and stores
- shared memory scenarios:
  - two TTA cores accessing an ideal SRAM with dual ports
  - 64 (or other large number) TTA cores accessing a shared memory
    via an arbiter
