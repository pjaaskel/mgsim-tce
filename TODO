simulation test cases to add
----------------------------
- multiple address spaces
- multibanked vector loads and stores
- shared memory scenarios:
  - two TTA cores accessing an ideal SRAM with two ports
  - 64 (or other large number) TTA cores accessing a shared memory
    via an arbiter
- TurboCore

integration to TCE and pocl
---------------------------
- TCE should detect if MGSim is available and build the integration
  wrappers as part of libtce.so. Use the MGSim dynlib discussed with Raphael?
- needs to be built with a recent compiler (C++11 support required)
- add system simulation test cases to the TCE systemtest suite
- add documentation on usage

integration API usability
-------------------------
- Possible to attach to a ttasim CLI and still use its step etc. for stepping
  the whole MGSim simulation: Create a wrapper to the regular TTA simulation
  engine that calls the MGSim step and which is called by the SimFront?

questions
---------
- DDR test case hangs (store does not get through) in case MemFreq != CoreFreq.
  What does the memory model's clock control? Seems I can still control the DDR
  frequency from the *DDR.Channel* section's :Freq.
